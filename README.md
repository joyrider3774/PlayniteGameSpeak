## Settings
Using the Settings -> Plugins -> Game Speak screen you can choose which texts to speak out and where (fullscreen, desktop, both or never).
You can also specify what should be said. There is a special variable `[game]` you can put in certain events that support it, where it will be replaced by the related game's name.
